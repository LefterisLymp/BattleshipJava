# BattleshipJava
ðŸš¢ ðŸ’£ An implementation of Battleship in Java. ECE NTUA 7th semester project.<br>
In order to run the game, Java 11 or a newer version must be installed. Additionally, JavaFX SDK 11 and packages javafx.controls and javafx.xml are needed. <br>

The game takes place in two 10x10 boards and the player who sinks all of the opponent's ships or has the most points after 40 rounds wins.

ðŸ“„ The game takes 2 txt files to run, which indicate where the player's ships and the computer's ships are:<br>
Take a look at the example files player_default.txt and enemy_default.txt. <br>

The format in these files is:
(a, b, c, d), where <br>

<b>a</b>: Ship id, where 1 is the carrier (5 tiles long), 2 is the battleship (4 tiles), 3 is the cruiser (3 tiles), 4 is the submarine (3 tiles), 5 is the destroyer (2 tiles) <br>
<b>b</b>: Row of the starting tile, counting from 0 <br>
<b>c</b>: Column of the starting tile, counting from 0 <br>
<b>d</b>: Alignment, where 1 is horizontal alignment and 2 is vertical. <br>

To run the game, compile and run Medialab_BattleshipFX/src/sample/Main.java. A pop up window will appear.
Open the "Application" menu and press the Load button in order to load the two files.<br>
In the "Enter player/computer scenario" section, state the absolute computer path where the txt files are located. <br>

Then click the Start button in the Application menu and the game begins.<br>

In order to fire a shot at the opponent, please enter at the bottom left side of the window the coordinates of the shot, counting from 0. <br>
During the game, in the Details menu, statistics can be seen concerning the enemy's ships and the last 5 shots each player has made.<br>

Various statistics also displayed at the screen during the game, indicating each player's point tally and shot accuracy among others.<br>

The application is divided into two packages inside Medialab_BattleshipFX/src directory:
* <b>battleship.javaproj</b> package implements the rules of the game. It contains the following classes:
  * <b>BattleshipJava</b> Combines all of the game's elements and conducts the game's process. It also calculates the points of the players and the number of moves remaining.
  * <b>Board</b> is the class of the game board. It contains information about its contents and how they are visualized to the player, whether it is the player's board or the computer's board.
  * <b>ComputerPlayer</b> is the class of the computer player. It calculates the moves played by the computer. The computer initially chooses random squares until it successfully hits a target. Then it chooses squares adjacent to the target until the ship is sunk.
  * <b>RegistryQueue</b> is a queue data structure. It is used to store the last 5 moves by the player and the computer and the status of the computer's ships.
  * <b>Ship</b> is the class of a ship and contains information about its status and the points awarded for sinking it. 5 classes inherit from this class, which are the 5 different ships, the <b>Battleship</b>, the <b>Carrier</b>, the <b>Cruiser</b>, the <b>Destroyer</b> and the <b>Submarine</b>.
* <b>sample</b> package contains classes which implement the graphical interface. These are:
  * <b>Main</b> is the main class which runs the game and connects with the <i>BattleshipJava</i> class.
  * <b>BoardFX</b> is the class that connects with the <i>Board</i> class and visualizes the player's and the computer's boards.
  * <b>AlertBox</b> is the class that makes a pop-up box appear with some text.
  * <b>TextBoxPopup</b> is the class that makes a pop-up box appear, which contains text boxes so that the player inputs the game scenarios (the 2 .txt files) to load a game.

Have fun!
